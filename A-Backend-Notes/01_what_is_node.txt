2. Node.js is a JavaScript in a different environment means running JavaScript on the server or any computer.

3. Build on Chrome's V8 Engine: It runs on the V8 engine, which compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code, enhancing performance.

4. V8 engine is written in C++ language for speed.

5. V8 + Backend Features = Node.js .

6. Design: Features an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model for efficiency.

7. Full-Stack JavaScript: Allows using JavaScript on both server and client sides.

8. Scalability: Ideal for scalable network applications due to its architecture.

Q-2 What are the features of Node.js.

1. Non-blocking I/O: Design to perform non-blocking operations by default, it Suitable for I/O-heavy operations.

2. Networking Support: Support TCP/UDP sockets, which are crucial for building lower-level network applications that browsers can not handle.

3. File System Access: Provides APIs to read and write files directly, which is not possible in browser environments for security reasons.

4. Server-Side Capabilities: Node.js enables JavaScript to run on the server, handling HTTP requests, file operations, and other server-side functionalities.

5. Modules: Organize code into reusable modules using require().
